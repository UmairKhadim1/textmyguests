# TextMyGuests - Text Guests at Your Event
Use TextMyGuests to keep all the guests at your event informed about what is happening and when it's happening. Use cases include

* Weddings
* Conferences
* Parties

Simply upload your "guests" names and phone numbers into the application, and then create as many "messages" as you like. Each message can be pre-scheduled for a certain date and time.
*
You may also send us a text in real time, and TextMyGuests will blast it out to all attendees of your event. 

The app supports subgroups (like "bridesmaids") so you can customize who receives which messages. 

You can also expose a public URL for your event so guests can add their own phone numbers to the distribution list for an event or subgroup, as well as view the message history for an event or subgroup.

TextMyGuests also handles replies - if your guests reply to messages, the app will aggregate those replies and send them back only to you, the event organizer.

The app supports multiple organizers per event if you like, so your spouse, event planner, or coworkers can create and send messages as well.

### SMS Delivery with Twilio

TextMyGuests uses Twilio to ensure timely message delivery. Each event is assigned a dedicated phone number for the duration of the event so guests can easily identify and reply to event-related communications.

### Simple, Per-Event Billing - Unlimited Messages
TextMyGuest is billed per event based on the number of guests attending. You can send unlimited messages to your event's guests - no need to keep track of message credits. Pay once and start communicating!
