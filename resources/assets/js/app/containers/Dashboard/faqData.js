    question: 'What is the best way to collect my guestsâ€™ phone numbers?',
    answer:
      'We recommend you collect cell phone numbers when your guests RSVP. This is easiest if you are collecting RSVPs on your wedding website because you can download the list from the website and upload it directly to TextMyGuests using our Add Bulk Guests function. If your phone numbers are not electronic, you can still Add Bulk Guests. Simply type up your list and upload it with a single click!',

    question: 'Can I share an event with my fiance, wedding planner, etc.?',
    answer:
      "Yes, you can invite co-owners in Event Settings. Co-owners are event-specific and have all the same permissions including billing, messages, adding guests and maintaining groups. To invite a co-owner simply go to Event Settings then Ownership, enter the person's email address, and click Invite. They will receive an automated email with a link that will prompt them to create a TextMyGuests account. You can add or remove co-owners at any time in Event Settings.",

    question: 'How should I decide what messages to send?',
    answer:
      'Messages should help your guests stay informed while not overwhelming them with too many details. An average wedding pre-schedules 6-10 messages to send throughout the weekend. If you are looking for message inspiration from real events, contact us using the Contact button below!',

    question: 'What is the purpose of Groups?',
    answer:
      "Group allow you to customize the messages each guest receives. For example, you could organize your guests into Out-of-Towners and In-Towners. Out-of-Towners will appreciate messages about transportation from the airport and things to do near the hotel, while In-Towners probably don't need this information.",

    question: 'What is the Reply Stream?',
    answer:
      'The Reply Stream is an awesome way to engage your guests in your special day! Encourage them to reply to the text thread with pictures, shout-outs, or well wishes. Their replies are collected in the Reply Stream. Only event owners can view the Reply Stream unless you choose to make it public. Paste the URL into one of your messages to share it with your guests. You can share it early so guests can enjoy it throughout the day, or share it afterwards so they can re-live the fun. Your choice!',
