			<p>Check out these messages from real events that used TextMyGuests!
				Remember, as the host, your guests receive all messages you send
				but their replies are only sent back to you. Replies can also be
				seen on the private Reply Stream URL that you'll get when you create
				your event. Share the URL with your guests so they can interact with
				each other!</p>
